# Global-Terrorism
The Global Terrorism Database (GTD)™ is the most comprehensive unclassified database of terrorist attacks in the world. The National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START) makes the GTD™ available via this site in an effort to increase understanding of terrorist violence, so that it can be more readily studied and defeated. 

The GTD™ is an open-source database, which provides information on domestic and international terrorist events around the world since 1970, and now includes more than 190,000 events. For each event, a wide range of information is available, including the date and location of the incident, the weapons used, nature of the target, the number of casualties, and – when identifiable – the group or individual responsible.
